            This topic was the subject of my master thesis.
            It is not published yet because we are in the process of writing a peer-reviewed article about it.
            Once it is, I will update this page with a post about the published results.

            <!--In the pursuit of a robust platform that allows to scalably perform quantum computations, it has 
            become obvious that we must apply error correction strategies.<br>
            These are ways to redundantly encode information such that the system possesses resilience to 
            loss of information. A wealth of knowledge in this field is readily available from classical information processing. From telecommunication to the human genome, redundant encoding is everywhere.<br>
            However, since the quantum world simply works differently, it would be shortsighted and frankly disrespectful to limit ourselves to these mere <i>classical</i> techniques.<br>
            The wondrous world of Quantum Mechanics of course offer its own unique ways to encode redundancy.
            One of the most revered ways people have come up with so far is the Gottesman Kitaev Preskill (GKP) encoding.
            This is an encoding scheme that relies on quantum observables of a continuous nature, like the quadratures of an electromagntic field.
